### Key Takeaways

- When choosing an application, favor the ones written in memory-safe languages (including for JNI integration).
- Do not use the `Unsafe` classes in your own Java code. If necessary, prefer the FFM API.
- Use SAST tools to detect and review future occurrences.
- Use SCA tools to keep your third-party dependencies free from CVEs.
