### It's complicated

Memory safety is not something binary, it's a continuum.

- You can write memory-safe software in C.
- You can write non memory-safe software in Java.
- But it's more difficult to write memory-safe software in C than in Java.
- And the larger and more complex the software is, the harder it gets.
