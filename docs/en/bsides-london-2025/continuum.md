### It's complicated...

Memory safety is not a binary property, it's a continuum<sup>[4]</sup>.

- You can write memory-safe software in C.
- You can write non memory-safe software in Java.
- But it's harder to write memory-safe software in C than in Java.
- And the larger and more complex the software is, the harder it gets.
