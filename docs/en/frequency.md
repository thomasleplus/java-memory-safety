### How big is the problem?

- Microsoft: "~70% of the vulnerabilities Microsoft assigns a CVE each year continue to be memory safety issues." <sup>[1]</sup>
- Google: "the Chromium project finds that around 70% of our serious security bugs are memory safety problems." <sup>[2]</sup>
- Mozilla: "of the 34 critical/high bugs we analyzed, 32 were memory-related." <sup>[3]</sup>

Note: Foresight from Java creators (but Python was first).
